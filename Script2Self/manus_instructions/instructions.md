## Instructions for Manus

1. Build a React-based frontend to take in user text.
2. Send text to backend for:
   - Emotion detection (via OpenAI API)
   - Text-to-speech (via ElevenLabs)
   - Generate a video clip using basic animation logic
3. Provide download and playback options

Use folders accordingly. See `docs/founder_vision.md` for guiding purpose.

Start by scaffolding the backend in `src/backend`, then wire the frontend.

The final product should output a playable MP4 video given any user input text.
